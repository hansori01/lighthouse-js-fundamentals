Write a function called laugh() that takes
one parameter (num) that represents the number of "ha"'s to return.

plan: laugh(num) 
- return is chuckle
- loop to add how many ha. or can we use*

//I can also do (let i=num ; num>0; num--);
    sound += 'ha';
  }
//every time loop runs, 'ha' is added to the sound variable.
  sound = sound + '!';
//once loop is done, the function adds ! to sound. (this is a local variable)
  return sound;
}
// return sound, so the function will show the outcome.
// This is returning the global (looped bank) then the local sound (!)
//will anything change if I use const? Yep. didn't work. Use let so we can access globally and locally.
console.log(laugh(1))

//this took a bit longer than I want to admit to figure out..
//here is same thing with a while loop for practice.

/*this was a complete opposite of how I thought. This uses the num variable
in the iterator expressions. Stops when num reaches zero, and 
it decreases in value. I had it set so it increases value until num-1. 
This seems a bit more simpler and straight foward than the for loop */

// each time the loop runs, it stores the letters backwards into the once empty variable bank.

// we have to return values in function. for some reason. I'm sure I'll know why soon.

we are running the reverseString which has a loop built into return the letters going backwards.
the parameter reverseMe is replaced with my name, the argument.

/* Prime number checker using function + loop

Composite - nubmers with more than 2 factors.

2 is the only even prime number.
Example: 11 = factors are only 1 and 11.

/*
Is this the same idea as the above?
Above puts the return true outside of the if statement.
It's acting like an implicit else, but becaseu it is one scope outside
of the if statement?
Interesting. I wonder which one is preferred...
